Sprint 2

# Additional Ideas (Overflow)
- Implement automation or business management features, allowing players to set up passive income streams. (Maybe be added into Briefcase)
- Incorporate detailed graphs and analytics for better strategic insight.
- Pause game / save game
- Crash Game handling
- leaderboard
- toturial
- Difficulty change


In this sprint, I will focus on expanding my game mecahnics. Adding the items in shop, and implementing a start timer within the menu bar, and address overall overflow from last sprint.

## Item Shop Development

To simplify the process, I will focus primarily on the **Network App** first, and then expand to the **Buy App**, **Sell App**, and eventually the **Briefcase**.

Items will have a randomized range value and will vary based on priority and time. 

### Approach and Considerations
- There will be a variety of items to include in the game, which creates a challenge in managing diversity.
- To make development easier, I will create a specific theme for the gameâ€”initially, a **School** theme.
- In future versions, I plan to introduce additional themes to diversify the items further.
- For now, the focus is on making the items relevant to the theme and straightforward to implement.


## Next Steps

After implementing the item shop and expanding the network app, I will shift my focus to:

- Developing the **Buy Items** and **Sell Items** functionalities.
- Implementing the **Timer**.

**NOTE** TO make my life easier Im first doing it in pseudo code

**BUG FOUND** So there is this bug where when I close and open a window it sways to the right eventually not letting me open the window because its unreachable. (result to overflow)

# Project Update

## Table
- An Excel-style table has been created, with detailed pseudocode included. (Best part is I made it into a dictionary list)

## Timer
- Timer screen has been integrated.
- Code has been restructured for better readability.
- The menu bar has been realigned.
- A countdown timer has been added beside the menu bar.
- All writen into pseudocode.

**NOTE** The menu bar is kinda useless, I will add the pause and save feature into the menu, but I cant really pause and save anything when nothing is being played. (meaning the next step is to add playability, which is the sell and buy)

## Game mechanic refinement
- Every 30 seconds, market prices will fluctuate within a specified range.
- Implement a range control dictionary to manage price variation ranges.
- Track available amount supply for each item.
- Incorporate demand-based probability for buying items.

**NOTE** I had a slight debate with my self, if I should use white text instead of black text below the icons.
